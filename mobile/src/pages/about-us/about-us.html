        <h3>e-MITRA</h3>

        <p>The Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) program is an important indicator of overall 
            functioning of health care delivery system in the country.
             The program is an amalgamation of multiple interventions and a multitude of 
             data is generated from various sources to track program implementation and progress.
              Due to the elaborate nature of the RMNCH+A program and the volume of data being generated,
               it often is difficult to collate and compile critical RMNCH+A indicators.</p>

        <p>The current toolkit offers one stop solution to assess RMNCH+A related statistics from different sources through a 
            combination of approaches. Designed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with support from
             USAID - VRIDDHI (Scaling up RMNCH+A Interventions) Project, e-MITRA provides customized snapshots of important indicators 
             pertaining to overall RMNCH+A Program and its respective themes.</p>

        <p>Data for 201 indicators with 4,71,831 data values from various secondary sources like Census, 
            Sample Registration System (SRS), National Family Health Survey (NFHS), District Level Household Survey (DLHS), 
            Annual Health Survey (AHS), Health Management Information System (HMIS) and primary sources like Supportive Supervision (SS) have 
            been collated. These data can be accessed by 
            geographical locations (national, state and district levels), by themes and by sources.</p>

        <p>Snapshot module provides access to latest data values of key performance indicators of overall RMNCH+A intervention,
             of various themes from recommended sources and of primary data sources 
            like HMIS and SS for any geographical level and from its various sources.  </p>

        <p>"Aspirational District" module has been included to provide easy access to important indicators for ensuring real time 
            monitoring of aspirational districts for facilitating effective and accurate decision making.   </p>

        <p>"Comparative profile" module provides users with the option to compare and visualize data for three different geographical 
            areas at any level e.g. national, state and district.</p>

        <p>“Data repository” view provides user the option to visualize the data of indicators as per source. Downloadable 
            links to the survey data sets are also available in the application by "Factsheets".</p>

        <p>The application provides data visualization across timelines for each data source in line, bar chart, tabular
             format and map visualization across different geographies.  </p>

        <p>The application aims to provide critical RMNCH+A information from across the country and is intended to help
             policy makers, program managers, implementers, academicians, researchers, health workers access and utilize 
             available data for effective decision making.</p>
